# Something.apk
#### Unofficial SomethingAwful forum browser for Android

This is a complete rewrite of [Awful.apk](https://github.com/Awful/Awful.apk).


## Project Setup
* Install Android Studio and the most recent SDK platform.
* Clone this repostory (including two git submodules).
```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/2fast2fourier/something.apk
```
or
```
git clone https://github.com/2fast2fourier/something.apk
cd something.apk
git submodule update --init --recursive
```
* In Android Studio, select "Import Project", then select the project folder.
* If it asks to confirm the Gradle configuration, verify that "Use default gradle wrapper" is selected and that the Gradle Project folder is pointing to the root of the project folder (not the gradle subfolder).
* Thats it!
